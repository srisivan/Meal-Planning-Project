# Meal-Planning-Project

This repository contains the project done for Design and Analysis of Algorithms course in Fall Semester 2024-25. 
In this prokect we aimed to create a program which would make it easier for individuals to scan their daily fixed menus, input their age and body dimensions, with which the program would calculate the average calorie intake needed for a day.

We then sought to implement the Knapsack Algorithm in our program using three different approaches:

1. Greedy Approach
2. Brute Force Approach
3. Dynamic Programming Approach

Further details of our project can be found in the pdf file attached to the repository.
